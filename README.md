# Data Structures & Algorithms Applications

Applications of data structures and algorithms. Included are notes and questions that are about data structures and algorithms.

## Notes

- Data structures are classified as either contiguous or linked, depending upon whether they are based on arrays or pointers:
  - Contiguously-allocated structures are composed of single slabs of memory (i.e. arrays, matrices, heaps, and hash tables)
  - Linked data structures are composed of distinct chunks of memory bound together by pointers (i.e. lists, trees, and graph adjacency lists)
